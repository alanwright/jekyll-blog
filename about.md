I am **Alan Wright**. I'm currently a software engineer for Microsoft [PowerBI](http://powerbi.com). I reside in Bellevue, WA.

Some of my latest creations include [NetflixBot](http://github.com/alanwright/netflixbot) and [BitDay.me](http://bitday.me). I also enjoy challenging myself with Project Euler. I'm currently coding in Python, C# and JavaScript and embracing flat design. If you'd like to work together, give me a shout.

I'd love if you checked out my [blog](http://alan-wright.com) and followed me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/iamalanwright) :)
